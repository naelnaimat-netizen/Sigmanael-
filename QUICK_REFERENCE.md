## When to Use Each Decision Action

### ACT IMMEDIATELY

- Complex dependencies
- Need coordination
- Skill gaps exist
- **Example:** Major product launch, market entry

### ACT IF CONVENIENT
- Low priority opportunity
- Spare resources available

### AVOID
- High risk, low return
- Resources too limited
- Pack not ready
- Better alternatives exist
- **Example:** Unfavorable contract, over-commitment

    ├─ 4. Coordinate response (assign roles)
    ├─ 5. Execute defense (act decisively)
    └─ 6. Regroup and learn (post-mortem)
```
